        /*
            What is an object?
            An object groups multiple values together.

            Syntax -
            const objectName = {
                propertyName1: value1, ->property-value pair
                propertyName2: value2
            };

            Many property-value pairs can be included in a object separated by commas.

            Inside an object we can save any type of value. Object themselves are also values.

       /*JSON Built-in Object*/

       /*
            Java Script Object Notation
                - a syntax
                - simmilar to javascript object
                - but has less features

            Difference between normal JS Object and JSON
                - all properties and strings must use double quotes
                  JSON does not support single quotes.
                - JSON does not support functions.

            Why use a JSON Syntax over a JS Object?
                JS Object only makes sense in JS. Whereas,
                Json can be unnderstood by almost every programming language.
            JSON is more UNIVERSAL.

            We use JSON
                - when we send data between computers.
                - when we store data.
            
            Built-in JSON Object
                Convert:
                JavaScript Object -> JSON
       */

       //Lets convert product2 object to JSON
       console.log(JSON.stringify(product2)); //string type output

       //JSON -> JavaScript Object
       const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2);
       console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString));









       /*localstorage Built-in Object*/

       /*
            localstorage
                - save values more permanently
                    unlike variables, who are temporary and gets deleted if we refresh/close the page.
                - only support strings.

            To save in localStorage - localStorage.setItem('name', string_value_that_we_want_to_store_in_localStorage*);

            To get value from localStorage - localStorage.getItem('name');

            To remove value from localStorage - localStorage.removeItem('name');

            *If the item to be stored is not already in string format then we have to convert it into string [ex- using JSON.stringify() method]. And convertit back into its original type while using localStorage.getItem() method.

            For usage example check 08-rock-paper-scissors.html file.

       // Auto-Boxing

       /*
            JavaScript automatically wraps the value into a special object first, so this value (before string/number/etc, now an object) has all the properties like an object.

            Auto-Boxing does not work with null or undefined.

       // Objects are actually references

       const object1 = {
        message: 'hello'
       };
       // When we create this object1 the actual value is created somewhere in the computer's memory.
       // The variable object1 just gets a reference that points to that location in the computer's memory.

       // The reason this works this way is to make the language more efficient. For example:
       const object2 = object1; //this only makes a copy of the reference that points to the object.
       // if we had a really big object, its not good to copy the object over and over again.
       //This is called COPY BY REFERENCE

       object1.message = 'Good job!';
       console.log(object1);
       // We r able to change the message property eventhough we created object1 with const.
       // const prevents us from changing the reference in the variable but it does not prevent us from reaching into the reference and changing the object that its pointing to.









       const object3 = {
        message: 'Good job!'
       };

       console.log(object3 === object1); //false
       // It'll show that both are not equal eventhough they have the same values inside.
       // Because, 'objects3' contains the reference.
       // object3 === object1 -> Here, references are compared, not the values inside.

       console.log(object2 === object1); //true
